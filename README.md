There is a script for downloading data
3. Misr image data can be loaded by the relevant part in the jupyter notebook or by `extract_misr_images.py` , 
this is done for 1 file for 1 channel, need to be done for all angles and all channels.
4. Geo data - use the script [eos2dump](https://hdfeos.org/software/eosdump.php) to extract the laitutude and longtitude from hdd file by   
```â€¨./eos2dump -vcm2 ./levelb2/MISR_AM1_GRP_ELLIPSOID_GM_P002_O112397_AA_F03_0024.hdf BlueBand all > lon.txt```  
```./eos2dump -vcm1 ./levelb2/MISR_AM1_GRP_ELLIPSOID_GM_P002_O112397_AA_F03_0024.hdf BlueBand all > lat.txt```
